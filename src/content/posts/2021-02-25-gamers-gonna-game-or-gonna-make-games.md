Making games with unity is fun! There is nothing like taking every single thought or critique from any game you have ever played and making it a reality. Playing games that don't have the "Well, if this game had this..." thought anymore is an awesome feeling. The best part about it is that we are on this journey together. On this site we will discuss games that we are playing, games that we are making, and tips and tricks that we pick up along the way. We aren't expert game designers or developers. But we can, with confidence say that we are game enthusiasts with many years of software development. So while we may not have the game experience, we definitely have the technical chops and over 30 years of games played. It will be fun to go on this ride together into the world of unity development. The best part about development, of all kinds, is there is no limits as to what you can create. This is just the beginning. Gamers gonna game!
