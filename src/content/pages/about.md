title: Whatcha Gonna Game?
---
I am a software developer by trade, game enthusiast by night (and also day). Gaming is at the core of who I am and have often dreamed of making my own games. Now I am on the journey to create my own games and I want to invite you along with me! I have developed at multiple start ups creating creating applications, websites, servers and everything in between. I am taking my love for gaming to the next step by learning how to use unity and hopefully you might find some of the things that I find useful also interesting to you. If learning how to do certain things is hard to find, I want to share it. Sometimes its really difficult to go through forums or youtube videos and figure out what is the correct path and what isn't. While I am on my journey to create games and how to create them well, I will also share those things that I found hard to find or difficult to understand. No more speed run "tutorials" that don't explain what a function does. No more copy and paste just to come back and try to find the same thing over and over. Unity development can be simpler, I am sure of it. It's going to take time. I want to help get you to where you want to be, and at the same time get myself to where I want to be.
